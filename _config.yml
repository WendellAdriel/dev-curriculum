bio: "Brazilian developer. Game, music and technology lover.
      I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development. I'm a Zend Certified PHP Engineer and Scrum Fundamentals Certified. I love to study and learn new skills,
      exchange work and study experience with people around me and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Web Development since 2009 and with
      Mobile Development since 2015 as Freelancer and in some Brazilian companies too.
      I'm the creator of CodeShare, a free portal with articles, videos, etc, about Software Development. The purpose of this project is to help people who want
      to learn about Software Development and start their careers in IT area and to help people that already work with Software Development to improve their
      technical knowledge to get better job opportunities.
      I like to work with both: Front-End and Back-End development. I work with many languages, frameworks and technologies."
